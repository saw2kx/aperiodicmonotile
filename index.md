title: A 3D-printable tiling of aperiodic monotiles
---
<body>

<h1>Let’s make a group tessellation.</h1>
<p>Everything you need is here and there are options from accessible easy prints to models for more advanced customisation.</p>

<h2>What is aperiodic monotile?</h2>
<p>A monotile is a single tile shape that tiles the plane by repeated copies of itself, and an aperiodic tiling is one that has no translational symmetry.</p>
<p>This project uses the hat tile, discovered in 2023 by amateur mathematician David Smith and published into a proof with his collaborators.  Find more information in <i>further reading</i> below.</p>

<p>Here is a tiling using hat tiles:</p>

<h2>How can I participate?</h2>

<p>We have prepared two different tiles: one with an open frame and one with a partitioned frame.  The spaces in the frame can be filled with either smaller tiles or with modifiers (more on that shortly).</p>

<p>Here is the open frame (white) with a inner hat tile (red):</p>

<p>Here is the partitioned frame (yellow) with one kite tile (green):</p>
